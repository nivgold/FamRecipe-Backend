Remove from pan and tent with foil on a plate for 10 minutes. In a large saute pan over medium heat, add the first teaspoon of olive oil and add the peppers and onion. Cook until tender about 3 minutes. Add the potatoes and remaining olive oil and cook until hot all the way through and golden on the outside. Meanwhile, chop the steak, and once the potatoes are cooked add the steak, toss and allow to cook an additional 2 minutes. Serve with fresh cilantro for a little freshness.',
